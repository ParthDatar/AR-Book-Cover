# AR-Book-Cover

## Book Cover 3D
The Book Cover 3D folder has the necessary Unity Assets to build the scene. Vuforia must be added as a package and libraries must also be imported. The assets, however, are complete.

## vtbn
vbtn is the C# code that controls the toggling of the review text and the primary text describing the book. Every time the virtual button is clicked, the text on the back cover toggles.

## SNK1Front and SNK1Back
Both of these files refer to the Title Shingeki no Kyojin, volume 1. They are the two target images.

## Movie MP4
While I would upload the movie with a new name, it would likely eat up too much bandwith. The movie, which is the MP4 file, demonstrates two Titans standing atop the front cover, with the title and the author. The book is flipped, and some statistics about the book are given, and the button is toggled to give a review. Here is what the text says for both:

### Primary:
Title: Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan)
Author: Isayama Hajime
Volumes: 33
Chapters: 139
Pages: Approximately 45 per chapter
Published: 2009-2021

### Review:
In my estimate, AoT is one of the finest manga ever written, 
and has a gripping plot which could rival any Hollywood production. 
It centers around ideas of revenge, duty, strategy, and most importantly tragedy.
No character is safe, and nothing is sacred. 
For a gritty read, do indulge.

## Limitations
The button is finnicky, and is detected sometimes when not pressed. Lighting and gloss on the screen has a big effect.
